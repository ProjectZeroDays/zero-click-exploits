Important Notes:

This is still a conceptual representation. The actual Python files and their content would depend on the specific requirements of your application.

The Python files listed are just examples, and you may have more or fewer files depending on the complexity of your application.

The content of the Python files would need to be written based on your application's logic and functionality.
This comprehensive list should give you a clear understanding of all the files we've discussed and "implemented" during our planning process, including the Python files that would be part of the application. Let me know if you have any further questions.

docs/style_guides/python_style_guide.md
Python Style Guide
This document outlines the coding style guidelines for Python projects. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

1. Code Formatting

Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.
Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
Two blank lines between top-level functions and classes.
One blank line between methods within a class.
Imports:
Group imports in the following order: standard library imports, third-party imports, local application imports.
Use absolute imports whenever possible.
Avoid wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *).
Whitespace:
Use spaces around operators (e.g., x = y + z).
Use spaces after commas in lists, tuples, and dictionaries (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
Avoid spaces inside parentheses, brackets, and braces (e.g., (x)).
2. Naming Conventions

Variables: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., user_name, total_count).
Constants: Use uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE, API_KEY).
Functions: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., calculate_sum, get_user_data).
Classes: Use CamelCase (e.g., UserData, ShoppingCart).
Modules: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., user_management, data_processing).
Packages: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., my_package, utils).
3. Comments and Documentation

Comments:
Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
Use inline comments sparingly.
Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.
Docstrings:
Use triple double quotes ("""Docstring goes here""") for docstrings.
Include a brief description of the function, class, or module.
Include parameter and return type information.
Follow the PEP 257 docstring conventions.
4. Error Handling

Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
Avoid bare except clauses (e.g., except:).
Log exceptions with meaningful error messages.
Raise custom exceptions when appropriate.
5. Best Practices

Write clear and concise code.
Avoid code duplication.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Follow the principle of single responsibility.
Write unit tests to ensure code quality.
Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
Use a linter and formatter to enforce coding style.
6. Tools

Linter: Use flake8 or pylint to check for style violations.
Formatter: Use black or autopep8 to automatically format code.
Virtual Environment: Use venv or virtualenv to manage dependencies.
Example:

def calculate_area(length, width):
    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle.

    Args:

# docs/style_guides/javascript_style_guide.md
# JavaScript Style Guide

This document outlines the coding style guidelines for JavaScript projects. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

**1. Code Formatting**

*   **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.
*   **Line Length:** Limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters.
*   **Semicolons:** Always use semicolons at the end of statements.
*   **Whitespace:**
    *   Use spaces around operators (e.g., `x = y + z`).
    *   Use spaces after commas in lists, objects, and function arguments (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`).
    *   Avoid spaces inside parentheses, brackets, and braces (e.g., `(x)`).
*   **Braces:**
    *   Use braces for all blocks, even single-line blocks.
    *   Place the opening brace on the same line as the statement.

**2. Naming Conventions**

*   **Variables:** Use camelCase (e.g., `userName`, `totalCount`).
*   **Constants:** Use UPPER_CASE with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`, `API_KEY`).
*   **Functions:** Use camelCase (e.g., `calculateSum`, `getUserData`).
*   **Classes:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserData`, `ShoppingCart`).
*   **Modules:** Use camelCase (e.g., `userManagement`, `dataProcessing`).
*   **Components (React/Vue):** Use PascalCase (e.g., `LoginButton`, `UserProfile`).

**3. Comments and Documentation**

*   **Comments:**
    *   Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
    *   Use inline comments sparingly.
    *   Use JSDoc-style comments to document functions, classes, and modules.
*   **JSDoc:**
    *   Use `/** ... */` for JSDoc comments.
    *   Include a brief description of the function, class, or module.
    *   Include parameter and return type information.

**4. Error Handling**

*   Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
*   Log exceptions with meaningful error messages.
*   Throw custom errors when appropriate.

**5. Best Practices**

*   Use `const` and `let` for variable declarations. Avoid `var`.
*   Write clear and concise code.
*   Avoid code duplication.
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   Follow the principle of single responsibility.
*   Write unit tests to ensure code quality.
*   Use a linter and formatter to enforce coding style.

**6. Tools**

*   **Linter:** Use ESLint to check for style violations and potential errors.
*   **Formatter:** Use Prettier to automatically format code.
*   **Bundler:** Use Webpack or Parcel to bundle JavaScript modules.

**Example:**
javascript
/**

Calculates the area of a rectangle.
@param {number} length The length of the rectangle.
@param {number} width The width of the rectangle.
@returns {number} The area of the rectangle.
*/
function calculateArea(length, width) {
const area = length * width;
return area;
}
/**

Represents user data.
*/
class UserData {
constructor(userId, userName) {
this.userId = userId;
this.userName = userName;
}
}

4. Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks (```language ...) for displaying code snippets.
Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python ..., ```javascript ...).
Use inline code blocks (`code`) for short code snippets within a paragraph.
5. Emphasis

Use bold text (**bold text** or __bold text__) for emphasis.
Use italic text (*italic text* or _italic text_) for emphasis.
Use bold and italic text (***bold and italic text*** or ___bold and italic text___) for strong emphasis.
Use emphasis sparingly and consistently.
6. Links

Use Markdown links ([link text](url)) for external links.
Use relative links for internal links within the repository.
Use descriptive link text.
7. Images

Use Markdown images (![alt text](image url)) for displaying images.
Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility.
Use relative paths for images within the repository.
8. Tables

Use Markdown tables for displaying tabular data.
Use consistent alignment within table columns.
Keep tables concise and easy to read.
9. Blockquotes

Use blockquotes (>) for quoting text from other sources.
Use blockquotes sparingly and appropriately.
10. Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules (---, ***, or ___) to separate sections.
Use horizontal rules sparingly and consistently.
11. Line Length

Limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters for readability.
